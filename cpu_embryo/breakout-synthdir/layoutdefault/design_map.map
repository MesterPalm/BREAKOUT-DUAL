Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   155 out of  18,224    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 154

  Number of Slice LUTs:                        225 out of   9,112    2%
    Number used as logic:                      214 out of   9,112    2%
      Number using O6 output only:             114
      Number using O5 output only:              64
      Number using O5 and O6:                   36
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     11
      Number with same-slice register load:      8
      Number with same-slice carry load:         3
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    85 out of   2,278    3%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          250
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           106 out of     250   42%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  25 out of     250   10%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         119 out of     250   47%
    Number of unique control sets:              12
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              54 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        33 out of     232   14%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                       33 out of      33  100%
    IOB Flip Flops:                             16
