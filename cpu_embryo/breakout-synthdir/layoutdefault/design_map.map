    Number used as logic:                    1,574 out of   9,112   17%
      Number using O6 output only:           1,194
      Number using O5 output only:              12
      Number using O5 and O6:                  368
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     43
      Number with same-slice register load:     39
      Number with same-slice carry load:         2
      Number with other load:                    2

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   535 out of   2,278   23%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,767
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           934 out of   1,767   52%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 150 out of   1,767    8%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         683 out of   1,767   38%
    Number of unique control sets:              32
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              67 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        28 out of     232   12%
